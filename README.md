This is a simple 2D driving simulator, developed for a self-driving PiCar project (University of Nottingham, Machine Learning in Science 2024). Physics are tuned for the Sunfounder PiCar-V, but can be easily modified. Made in collaboration with @DoctorDinosaur.

Requires PyGame and Numpy: Run `pip install pygame numpy` in your venv.
