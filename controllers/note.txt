it's important that the state is as concise as possible

things which MUST be included in the state (i.e. things that could affect the desired
behaviour):

  1.  the car's position within the tracks (could be single value?)

  2.  the presence of any obstacles, if in the way of desired path (most obstacles
      outside of path can be ignored)

  3.  the presence of RED traffic lights outside of path (ignore green)

  4.  the presence of a junction, and which way the sign indicates to go

these can be used to form a desired path or perhaps a single target point, which a
simple model can be used to follow via speed/steer values

single target point for simple stuff like following a road, multiple target points
for complex stuff like junctions?

ideally compare this with standard approach (cnn -> controls) and transformer approach
